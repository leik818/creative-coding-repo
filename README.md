### assignment 4:
for this assignment, i was inspired by vera molnar's 1985 piece, *untitled*, by adapting some code from [this site](https://www.101computing.net/vera-molnar-artwork-revisited-using-python/). i changed the number of columns, adjusted the shapes into squares, and made them pink! 

the inspiration:

### assignment 5
for this assignment, i used assets from [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/) to make a game where a [little robot](https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-robot) eats [gears](https://opengameart.org/content/gear-pixel-art-32x32) for his breakfast. for fun, i made the [background](https://opengameart.org/content/arcade-carpet-textures) the same pattersn as old arcade carpet, and added a little [background music](https://opengameart.org/content/cute-bytes-ost-cheers-for-starlight). 

this is what the game ended up looking like:

### assignment 6 
for this assignment, i looked at a data set from [opendata.nyc]( https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) that has data on [affordable housing production by building](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr/about_data), that count towards the goals of either the *housing new york* or *housing our neighbors* plans. i wanted to see which borough had the most new units built, and how many total units were created under these plans. i was suprised to see how few units were built in staten island!

### assignment 7 
for this assignment, i tried to scrape images from one of my favorite artists'[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wojnarowicz). oddly, his page only had one image though! i struggled to get the directory for the images to work, but i think i got there in the end.

### assignment 9 
for this assignment, i tried to combine some of the interface layout code and bad ui we went over in class. i edited the phone dial code so that random numbers would pop up instead of the number you actually wanted to press.
